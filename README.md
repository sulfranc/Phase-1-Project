Phase 1 Project

CAT LIKER 

-----------------

This is my cat liker javacript project.
This projects displays a random imange from a cat api and puts it on the screen.
From there the user has the option of likeing the cat picture or disliking it.
Later I will add a feature that will show you how much likes and dislikes you have.
I used emojipedia for the thumbs emoji and useed the The Cat API
